Git Repository Guidelines in Agile Development:

Git is a distributed version control system that is commonly used in agile development.

It is important to establish guidelines for using Git in a team environment to ensure 
consistency and avoid conflicts.

One guideline is to use a branching strategy, such as Gitflow, to organize the codebase 
and manage releases.

Another guideline is to use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the changes 
made in each commit.

It is also important to use pull requests for code reviews to ensure that changes are 
thoroughly reviewed and tested before being merged into the main codebase.

Regularly merging changes from the main codebase into individual branches can help avoid 
conflicts and ensure that all code is up-to-date.

It is recommended to use Git hooks to automate tasks, such as running tests and code 
linting, to maintain code quality and consistency.

Finally, it is important to establish backup and disaster recovery processes to ensure 
that code is not lost in case of hardware or software failures.
